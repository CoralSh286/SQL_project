## תיאור הארגון
This project involves designing and managing a relational database for a maternity ward. The database stores information about doctors, nurses, mothers, babies, visitors, and rooms. The primary functionality includes managing patient admissions, assigning medical staff to rooms, and tracking medical treatments, including prescribed medications for mothers.

### Purpose
The purpose of the database for the maternity ward is to streamline the management of information related to mothers, babies, doctors, nurses, medications, and rooms in the hospital. The database aims to ensure efficient storage, management, and quick retrieval of critical data concerning patients in the ward. It includes information about mothers, the babies born to them, the medications they are receiving, the doctors treating them, the nurses providing care, and details about the rooms they are staying in. This enables precise tracking of treatments, dosages, types of deliveries, medical histories, and ensures the well-being of the babies, their health, and the proper coordination of medical resources. The database also contributes to improved communication among medical and nursing teams and supports data-driven medical decision-making in real time.
